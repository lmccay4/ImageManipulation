# ImageManipulation

Program to edit images on a pixel level including methods to sort, scatter, and merge separate images.

Sort an image gradually by a specified number of images to output in order to create an animation such as:

Sort each pixel in each row of the image by color:

Scatter every pixel randomly throughout the image:

Sort the scattered image for a smoother histogram-esque representation of the pixels the exist in the image:

Merge two images of the same size into each other by interweaving each pixel between images:

Also a glitch art-esque sort in abstractSort() which produces images such as:
